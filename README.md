This is simple demonstration of proficiency with Python. The file named Firm Valuation Code.ipynb is a string of code that will compute a very basic firm valuation at time zero if provided with a csv of an income statement and balance sheet. 
The file is compatible with python, and was written specifically with the Jupyter Notebook.
This file requires the installation of Pandas, a commonly used data analytics program within Python.
This code is functional as of 12/19/2023, but may require tweaking as it does upload from html sources.
If an individual would like to use this code to value other firms, please note that the firm valuation software does not value the cost of debt beyond using the risk free rate on the average maturity of treasury bonds between 2 and 30 years.
Additionally, this software does not evaluate beta, and requires that beta is calculated by the user.
Finally, csv documents were retrieved from https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/

Best,
